# newsdedup
Starting project to try to deduplicate my news feed. 

For a long time I've added many RSS feeds and lately I've had lot of duplicate
entries for big stories. With this project I aim to move duplicates to starred
and mark them as read. This might change in the future if I find a better way
to do it.
